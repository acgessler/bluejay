Milestone 1:
============

Rought checklist of what we want:

a) A basic server that handles the following string commands:
 "<someVariableName> = <someNumber>"
 "<someVariableName>"
The first command creates a named variable on the server and assigns it
the given number. It then sends the value to the client as a confirmation.
The second command sends the current value of the given variable to the
client. In case of errors, the server sends an appropriate error message.

b) A basic client that allows the user to connect to a server and to 
set and print variables according to the simple protocol from a)

c) some basic tests for the protocol implementation on the server,
using junit.
